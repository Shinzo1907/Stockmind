# Hybrid Multi-Agent RAG Model for Stock Market Analysis

This repository presents the **Hybrid Multi-Agent RAG Model**, an advanced AI-driven solution for real-time stock market analysis, designed to provide a holistic view of the market by integrating diverse data sources and machine learning models.

## Overview

The Hybrid Multi-Agent RAG Model is an innovative approach for financial analysts, data scientists, and investors to gain actionable insights into stock market dynamics. This model combines various analysis types—technical, fundamental, sentiment, and news-driven—through an efficient, multi-agent framework. 

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Stock Analysis**  
  Provides technical, fundamental, and sentiment analyses to deliver a holistic view of stocks.

- **Efficient Data Retrieval**  
  Uses the FAISS index to store embeddings for fast, accurate responses to queries, minimizing redundant computations.

- **Dynamic User Interaction**  
  A multi-agent system manages diverse analyses, delivering a seamless, interactive user experience.

- **Robust Machine Learning Models**  
  Leverages the Sentence Transformer for text embeddings and a custom sentiment model for sentiment prediction.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit, the platform offers a straightforward front end for stock queries and reports.

- **Real-Time Data**  
  Integrated with yfinance and TradingView for real-time stock news, price data, and trend analysis.

## Architecture Components

1. **Vector Store**  
   Utilizes FAISS for storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently.

2. **Agents**  
   The system includes specialized agents for Conversing, Researching, Technical Analysis, Fundamental Analysis, and Reporting.

3. **Tools**  
   Custom tools assist agents in performing technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and more.

4. **Search Engine API**  
   The Serper API retrieves real-time data from Google for up-to-date analysis.

5. **LLM Integration**  
   OpenAI or LLama models support agents with natural language understanding and self-evaluation.

6. **External Data Sources**  
   Integrates data from yfinance (financial data) and TradingView (news) for robust analysis.

## Performance and Evaluation

The model has been benchmarked for different analysis types (technical, fundamental, sentiment), showcasing high accuracy and speed in generating consistent, relevant, and factually accurate responses for a wide range of stocks.

## Key Advantages

- **Consistency and Accuracy**: Ensures high accuracy and consistency through reliable financial sources.
- **Recursive Self-Evaluation**: Reflects on past decisions, continuously improving output.
- **Error Correction**: Corrects decision-making errors by backtracking through non-optimal reasoning paths.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Key Challenges

- **Complexity of Analysis**: Presenting multi-faceted insights clearly and effectively.
- **Customization Needs**: Supporting diverse user requirements and preferences.
- **API Compatibility**: Ensuring smooth integration with financial APIs.

### Innovative Solutions

- **Cached Responses**: Reduces latency by caching frequently queried data.
- **Web Scraping**: Reduces reliance on costly APIs by scraping relevant financial data.
- **Tree of Thought Framework**: Backtracks on flawed reasoning paths, improving decision accuracy.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Integrate advanced models for predictive analytics.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Enable simultaneous analysis of multiple stocks.
- **Response Templates**: Develop standardized responses for specific business contexts.
